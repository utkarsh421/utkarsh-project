Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel Bookings
📌 Project Overview
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project investigates hotel booking cancellations and their patterns and suggests actionable measures to reduce cancellations and secure revenue.

The dataset includes booking details for:

City Hotels and Resort Hotels
Booking dates and length of stay
Number of guests (adults, children, babies)
The project explores key insights through EDA and data visualization techniques to help hotels improve revenue management strategies.

🎯 Objectives
This project aims to:
✅ Identify factors influencing booking cancellations.
✅ Provide data-driven strategies to reduce cancellations.
✅ Analyze seasonal trends and customer booking behavior.
✅ Suggest hotel incentives (e.g., discounts, free services) to encourage direct bookings.

🛠 EDA Process
The EDA process is divided into the following steps:

1️⃣ Data Exploration & Inspection

Understanding the raw dataset structure.
Identifying key variables affecting hotel bookings.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values.
Removing irrelevant data.
3️⃣ Data Analysis & Visualization

Univariate Analysis: Examining single-variable distributions.
Bivariate Analysis: Studying relationships between two variables.
Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing interactions among multiple variables.
📊 Key Insights & Findings
By analyzing hotel booking data, we can:
✅ Identify peak booking seasons and high-cancellation periods.
✅ Recognize factors influencing cancellations (e.g., lead time, booking source).
✅ Recommend strategies to reduce cancellations and maximize revenue.

For example:

Offering discounts for early bookings encourages advance reservations.
Providing incentives (e.g., free parking, breakfast) for direct bookings increases revenue.
Monitoring cancellation trends helps hotels adjust policies and pricing dynamically.
